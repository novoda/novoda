# The Official Novoda Kotlin Style Guide.

## Baseline

Unless we defined otherwise on this page we are to follow the default [Android Style Guide for Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide).

Additionally, we use [Ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) for linting (`ktlint`) and auto-formatting (`ktlintFormat`). 

### Important: 
~~Make sure you run `ktlintFormat` before committing or at the very least before opening a PR.~~

## Prime directives

 - Rules are made to make our life easier, not harder.
 - If we don't like something, we can change it.
 - If we want to change something, we need objective reasons.

## Conventions

### Expression vs block body:

Block body (using `{}`) should be used in cases when the return is `Unit` and there is more than one operation.

**YEP**
```koltin
fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate() // first operation
  setContentView(R.layout.my_layout) // second operation
}
```
**NOPE**
```kotlin
fun onCreate() = super.onCreate().also { 
  setContentView(R.layout.my_layout) 
}
```

### When to specify return type?

Specifying the return type of a function or a property should always be present when they are public or internal. It's ok to not provide it on private ones as the scope should be clear enough to determine. Similarly to how we don't define the type for local properties (inside a function). 

One special case could we if we have a complex operation in a function. However, we should strive for small atomic operations and their combination rather than a long and arduous chain of operations. Especially with extension functions.

### When to use lateinit vs lazy vs property without a field?

#### lateinit
- Using `lateinit` is equivalent to a `@SuppressWarming` as it acknowledges that something can go wrong but we are confident it won't happen. The next person that comes to change your code may not be so confident. 
- Use `lateinit` when a value **will** be used in the future but it has to be initialized at a later time.

#### lazy
- Lazy creates an object that we use to delegate the value so it's evaluated once needed. There shouldn't be more than a handful of `lazy` properties. It could be the case that they are used to create another lazy property, in which case we can extract that to a factory function. 
- If you must use `lazy` and you are not under a multithread environment (as in an Activity creation) avoid locking the class using `lazy(LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE)`, we might provide an alias for this in the future. 
- Use `lazy(LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE)` when a field might not be used at all and it's optional.

```kotlin
fun <T> lazySingleThread(initializer: () -> T): Lazy<T> = lazy(LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE, initializer)
```

#### Property without a field
- Sometimes, if we only need an object once or in infrequent occasions (use clicks) and it's not expensive to obtain then we may be able to use a property without a backing field.

```kotlin
val notificationService get() = app.getNotificationServiceFor(this)
```

### let/also/apply/run/with When to use which?

|  | Receiver(`this`) | Parameter(`it`) || Not extension |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Returns self | `apply { invoke() }` | `also { it.invoke() }` | | `with(obj) { invoke() }` |
| Returns result | `run { invoke() }` | `let { it.invoke() }` | | |

 - The first row returns the object to which this operation was applied to (subject) irrespectively to what we do inside.
 - The second row returns the result from what we do inside of the provided closure.
 - The fist column takes the subject as the receiver of the closure, we don't have to refer to the subject
 - The second column takes the subject as a parameter instead, so we have to reference `it` or by name is we give it a name inside the lambda.
 - The last column is a special case for `with` which can be considered an alias of `apply`.

Use cases:

 - `apply`: when we are mutating one or multiple properties but we want to continue more operations with the subject (like returning it)
```kotlin
fun State.toLoading() = apply {
  type = Loading
  count = 0
})
```
 - `with`: THis one is, to all effects, an alias of `apply` which takes the subject as a parameter instead of as the receiver of the function. Can be used when creating a type that we want to mutate straight away.
```kotlin
val state = with(State()) {
  type = Loading
  count = 0
}
```
 - `also`: When we want to make clear the name of the object that we are operating on (renaming `it`) or we are inside of a context where `apply` may be ambiguous.
```kotlin
fun State.resetWithOne() = this.toLoading().also { it.count = 1 }
```
In this case, if we use `apply` we have to use `this@also` to refer to the new state.
 - `run`: If we want to convert from a type to another and we have a single action or we want to inherit properties from the same object.
```kotlin
val fullname = user.run { "$name $surname" }
```
With `name` and `surname` being properties of `user`. Here we save having to name the subject of the extension or use `it`.
 - `let`: Sort of an alias for `map` and `flatmap` but for a single and unwrapped object. Useful to change the order or requirements.
```kotlin
val userRank = user.let { rankFor(it.id) }
```
Saves having to make a redundant property, similar to what we do with `nullable`. Instead of doing:

```
if(input != null) {
  val trullyNotNull = input!!
  return createFromNotNull(trullyNotNull)
} 
```
We can do:
```kotlin
input?.let { createFromNotNull(it) }
```

This is especially important when consuming properties that aren't local as we have no warranties that the value in `input` will remain not null after we checked it. With `let` here we can grab a copy of the current value and deal with it on-site.

**Note:**

These functions should be used when we are using the receiver of the function inside of the closure, otherwise a simple if-else or where statement is more readable.
Do not use `this` keyword inside `apply`, `with`, and `run`. - because `this` can be confusing inside there 
Only use `?.let` if you use consume the `it` inside, otherwise just use `if`.
 
**Note 2:**

All these functions (but specially `run`) can be run without an explicit receiver, in which case the receiver is the object we are in a particular scope. 
 
```kotlin
class Somer {
  val value = run { // this here is Somer
    val dependencyOne = resolveDependency(One)
    val dependencyTwo = resolveDependency(Two)
    createValue(dependencyOne, dependencyTwo)
  }
}
```


### Extension functions location

Where do we put extension functions depends on two factors: Does it change state and how reusable is it.

 - Inside a type as private:
If we have an extension function that changes the internal state of an object (not the one being extended) it should always live inside of the object.

 - In the file as private:
The logic of the function is only relevant to one or many of the types defined in that file

 - In a file as public:
Only if the file contains just extension functions. When do we extract them to an extension file? This should come to on-time judgment. Each situation may be different. However, the golden rule is that there is some functionality that can be used by more than one component.

### Companion object vs file definitions (properties and functions)

Properties and functions that are required across multiple **instances** can live in the file (as private). Rationale: We avoid creating a new object as when defining a companion object we effectively doing that.

Properties and functions that are required across multiple **types** can live in the companion type *if* we require namespacing for that particular type. This is especially important when declaring a factory function that creates instances of a given type: `MyComponent.from()`.

If we declare something on a file (type, function or property) it belongs to the package in Kotlin and to the class generated for Java (MyFileKt).

### When to use aliases and where should they be declared?

Cases were we can use type aliases:
  - Name clash from an external library (as opposed to an import alias)
  - Generics make a type too long.

Case to **NOT** use type aliases:
  - To shadow the type of a function. For example:
```kotlin
typealias UserProcessor = (User) -> Unit
```
This adds cognitive overhead and adds no more readability.

### Functions and Constructors:

For both constructors and functions, if there is more than 2 parameter then we put each on their own line. Both for their definition and their usage.

**YEP**
```kotlin
data class User(
  val name: String,
  val surname: String,
  val dab: Date
)
```
**NOPE**
```kotlin
data class User(val name: String,
                val surname: String,
                val dab: Date)
```
(Look at all that space, one could build a cathedral in there.)

*Rational:* This makes it clear what parameters do we have available (with long names we may miss the first one) and makes fewer changes (on PRs) when we want to do refactors like renaming or adding/removing parameters. A rename of the type would shift every line of the constructor.

### Factory functions:

Use named factory functions (`newInstance`, `create`, etc. ) either on the `companion` object or in a separate `*Factory` file.

Kotlin allows defining `operator fun invoke()` function that can be called without `invoke` just by using the brackets `()`. This approach for creating factory methods can lead to subtle accidental behaviour that can be really hard to understand. 

Consider the following (contrived) example. It's not obvious which method is called when a new user instance is created.
```
class User internal constructor() {

    companion object {
        operator fun invoke() = User()
    }
}

val user = User()
```

As opposed to this approach:
```
class User internal constructor() {

    companion object {
        fun newInstance() = User()
    }
}

val user = User.newInstance()
```

### Data classes:

  - The constructor should not be private, even if unused. It's not possible to hide it completely as data classes generate `copy` functions. There is a conversation about this here:  https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11914

#### Where to declare them, nested or at the same level?

This depends on its visibility. If we have a `private` sealed class then it is safe to have them in the same level, for external usage then we should nest them to avoid name clashing.

## Functions as parameters

> Kotlin functions are [first-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function), which means that they can be stored in variables and data structures, passed as arguments to and returned from other higher-order functions. You can operate with functions in any way that is possible for other non-function values.

**YES**: Functions can be passed as parameter to other functions o class constructors


Interfaces with only one function can be replaced with top level functions. There are multiple benefits:

  - Functions are stateless: it makes easier to avoid bugs created by undesired internal state changes.
  - Less code to maintain means less possible errors, fewer maintenance and less changes during refactors.
  - It simplifies testing: a class receiving a function as a parameter knows for sure that this collaborator is stateles. It's very easy to provide a fake function for testing purposes. 

**NOPE**: Functions that transform from basic types, such as `(Int) -> String` or `(String, Int) -> Boolean` are **NOT** good entry parameter types. In those cases, it's very hard to identify what this function does or where's the implementation. 
### Bad example of parameter functions:

```kotlin
class GlobalVariablesProducer(
    videoIdParser: (Int) -> String,
    ageRater: (Int) -> Boolean,
    durationCalculator: (Int) -> Int) {}
```

These funtions are difficult to work with: we don't know what they're doing from the signature and they are prone to error because they entry and return types are not restricted to a domain. 

### Good example of parameter functions:
```kotlin
class GlobalVariablesProducer(
    videoIdParser: (RawResponseId) -> VideoId,
    ageRater: (UserAge) -> AgeRating,
    durationCalculator: (TimeInMillis) -> VideoDuration
) {}
```
These functions are easy to work with: we know exaclty what they are doing by just reading the signature. Their types are strong and bound to our domain, so it's harder to pass a wrong value to them. 
And it's easy to mock them in tests, for example, passing a function that always return a valid `AgeRating` is as simple as passing: `{AgeRating.Valid}` 

## Interfaces

**NOPE**
Do not use platform-system interfaces as parameters in class constructor except for data structures. It makes it impossible to find out who is implementing what you are passing.

Do not create an interface that has just one implementation if it's not strictly necessary. 
- Adds one more level of indirection that's unnecessary

Avoid system-wide use of interfaces with hundreds of different implementations, like `Marshaller`. This is similar in approach to `do not use platform-system` interfaces.

**YES**
There are different valid implementation and you want to make sure that those implementations are easily swappable.
